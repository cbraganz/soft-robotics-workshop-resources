## ðŸª±ðŸ¤– Soft Robotics Rice Paper Workshop

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the Soft Robotics Workshop using rice paper!

This workshop is designed to introduce the public to soft robotics through a fun, low-cost, and accessible approach. The core activity focuses on creating rice paper actuators, which can be easily adapted into your own version of the workshop. This is a hands-on session Iâ€™ve developed and successfully led with multiple groups of students.

The details required for you to understand the material characteristics and how to use and demo rice paper are all provided on the website here: https://cbraganz.github.io/ with images and videos! If you want to run the workshop I created using the powerpoint in the repository, read on!

## ðŸ“š Workshop Overview

In this workshop, the participants will:
- Learn about soft robotics, biomimicry and real world applications.
- Experiment and play with silicone grippers.
- Get hands-on experience with building soft actuators with rice paper.
